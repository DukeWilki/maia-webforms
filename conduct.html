            and paid by the due date as stipulated by the MOCC Committee.
            Failure to do so will result in the member voiding their MOCC &

          <ul>
            Participate in flip drills, swim test and treading water test yearly

            get in and out of a canoe unassisted or with minimal assistance from
            fellow paddlers. In the event that a member fails either the annual
            swim or tread water test, that member must wear an approved Personal
            Floatation Device (PFD – Type 1, 2 or 3) at all times whilst
            training or competing in any form of outrigger canoe as outlined by
            AOCRA. Failure to comply may void the AOCRA member’s personal
            insurance coverage and negate any claims arising from an incident
